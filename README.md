#Phase Five Project -- Treadlite

###Treadlite aims to bring awareness to peoples' carbon footprint, using a complex and comprehensive scoring method. 

## Introduction

Treadlite was created as a personal project while attending Flatiron SE bootcamp. It was the final project of the course and aimed to showcase my skills as a fullstack developer. It utilizes React on the front-end, and Ruby on the back-end. I chose to make a carbon-footprint calculator because reducing our collective carbon-footprint is something i'm passionate about.

## Technologies

* React.js
* Ruby version 2.7.4
* Rails version 7.0.0
* bcrypt (for secure login/singup)
* MUI - (for styling) A huge shoutout to the people behind this!
* Heroku (thank you for hosting this!)


## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../treadlite
$ npm start --prefix client
$ rails s

```
